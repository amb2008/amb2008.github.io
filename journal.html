	<h3 style="font-family: courier; font-size: 24px;">What I've Learned So Far</h3>
	<p style="font-family: courier;"><strong>September 29, 2022:</strong><br>So far I've learned how to create text, divs, change the style of texts, make hover effects, make a marquee, and create a website. I have had a lot of fun doing random things and making fun features like having a cookie expand horizontally. I feel like there is a lot of unnecessary structure to html like the tags and different sections. It is not nearly as intuitive as python but it is still pretty good. I look forward to learning more and experimenting with more features, especially a menu! </p>
	<p style="font-family: courier;"><strong>October 8, 2022:</strong><br>Since my past entry I've built a menu, used links to bring me to other files and places within my website, used a gif as a background image, and experimented with deign elements of html like opacity and font. I'm liking courier as a font right now, but futura is good too. I'm getting more used to the html formatting. Sometimes positioning can be confusing but I'm mainly using 'absolute' for everything besides the menu which I use 'fixed' for. I'd be interested in learning how to make my menu disappear when you scroll down and reappear when you scroll up so it doesn't block your view but is still accessable. I also want to learn how to do a click command.</p>
	<p style="font-family: courier;"><strong>October 14, 2022:</strong><br>I learned how to use keyframes and made a fun animation on my website to make an explore button appear. I also made a digital pumpkin patch where if you hover over a pumpkin another object will appear. That is not an animation but it is still fun. I will try to learn some java script to make even more interesting animations.</p>
	<p style="font-family: courier;"><strong>November 9, 2022:</strong><br>I learned a bunch of javascript and using event listeners. I can now click and make a box move wherever I click, or make a box follow wherever my mouse moves. I also learned how to make things happen when I scroll, and in relation to the displacement of my page. I want to learn more with javascript, maybe making games or just cool design effects. I also made a creamcis website that looks pretty cool.</p>
