	<h3 style="font-family: courier; font-size: 24px;">What I've Learned So Far</h3>
	<p style="font-family: courier;"><strong>September 29, 2022:</strong><br>So far I've learned how to create text, divs, change the style of texts, make hover effects, make a marquee, and create a website. I have had a lot of fun doing random things and making fun features like having a cookie expand horizontally. I feel like there is a lot of unnecessary structure to html like the tags and different sections. It is not nearly as intuitive as python but it is still pretty good. I look forward to learning more and experimenting with more features, especially a menu! </p>
